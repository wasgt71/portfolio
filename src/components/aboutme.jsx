            Hello! My name is Tristan, I am a developer who specializes in
            JavaScript. I started programming as a hobby and then it turned into
            addiction. I've been writing software almost every day since. I am
            passionate about creating applications that either automate or make
            other people's lives easier. I also love a good challenge and enjoy
            tackling seemingly impossible projects to learn and grow. Below are
            some of my favourite projects.
