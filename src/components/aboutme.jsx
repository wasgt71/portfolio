            <p>
              Hello! My name is Tristan, and I am a developer who specializes in
              JavaScript. I started programming as a hobby that turned into an
              addiction. I've been writing software almost every day since. I am
              passionate about creating applications that either automate or
              make other people's lives easier. I also love a good challenge and
              enjoy tackling seemingly impossible projects to learn and grow.
